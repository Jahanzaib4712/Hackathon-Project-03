🚁 Hackathon Day 1: Task Complete! 🚁

Excited to kick off our journey at the hackathon with HeliRoyale, a platform for helicopter rental and purchase! 🌟

Today, I successfully completed Day 1’s task by creating a clear roadmap for our project. Here's what we accomplished:

Outlining the core features and user flows.
Planning a dynamic, scalable structure using Next.js.
Integrating Sanity as the backbone for content management.
This roadmap will guide us as we build a fully functional website over the next few days! 🚀

Looking forward to turning these plans into reality. Feedback and encouragement are always welcome! 😊
